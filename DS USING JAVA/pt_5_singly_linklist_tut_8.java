//linklist is also a linear data structure like an array..
//Random memory available is same as memory available in the form of chunks..
//one of the good advantage of linklist is that we don't need to define the size of linlist initially as compare to array..
//Accessing elements in linklist take more time as compare to array..
//require more memory compare to array..
//but there is no wastage to memory in linklist as compare to array..
//Traversing time or search time in linklist is high compare to array..
//In linklist time complexity is primary concern space complexity is not a primary concern where as in array space complexity is primary concern time complexity is not  a primary concern..
